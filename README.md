Hi ! I'm a web full stack developer close to graduation from the Henry academy, after an intensive 4 month bootcamp course, where I incorporated knowledge and practice on current web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, NodeJS, React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, and others to my prior expertise and experience with IT systems.

Recently retired from a large multinational company, I'm looking to continue in the job market now as a programmer which has always been my favourite role, as it demands creativity, ingenuity, and has a direct impact in process improvement and productivity. I believe my long experience dealing with systems implementations, plus my educational background as an engineer student, gives me an edge that adds value to my role as a programmer team member and thus can contribute to the success of any project.

I have an analytical mind and love to solve complex problems. I am more than willing to inmerse myself in the world of internet as a programmer with business criteria no just as a coder.

From my past experience which you can read in more detail in my resume, I can sintetize as follows:

33 years working for Citibank at technology and financial control positions in various countries. Based in Argentina, worked 10 years abroad. Strong technology background by education and experience gained in various succesfull implementations, later moved to the Finance area on a more business oriented role while retaining the technical expertise which has been key in providing specialized support to all departamental information needs, and automating their processes.
Specialties: Processes improvement. Special Projects. Liason between business and technology areas. Functional analyst. Data warehouse design and implementations, management information systems solutions, financial dashboards, BI applications, mainly for the banking sector. Database automation.

And now: Web Full Stack developer with a preference for databases and backend work.


This GitHub is not complete yet. I will be adding more info and showcase some of my projects.
